Hooksure allows you to map SureForms, form submissions to webhooks dynamically within your WordPress admin dashboard without needing the pro plugin.

== Description ==

Hooksure provides a straightforward way to manage webhooks for your SureForms forms.

Hooksure handles sending webform submissions created in SureForms to your webhook of choice, i.e. Flowmattic, Bit Flows or Pabbly Connect.

It allows you to pass that data over to an external service to process it as you would any normal webhook.

Want to send data and receive data back to your SureForms but not use SureTriggers?  

Well, if you want to use Zapier, Flowmattic, Bit Flows, or Pabbly Connect, you can do this with Response for Sureforms, which handles the sending and returning of webform data.

We've recently implemented dynamic form population and better error handling directly from Response for SureForms into HookSure, making it better than ever than its initial launch.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hooksure` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools â†’ Hooksure** to start mapping your forms to webhooks.
